Working with command line on Windows is always an awful experience. Cmder project was created to bring beautiful custom design to all users - straightforward and without unnecessary configuration. This project stemmed out of own need and recieved lot of shocking feedback from community with [Around 5000](https://github.com/bliker/cmder/stargazers).

**You can find Cmder [on Github](https://github.com/bliker/cmder) <br>
